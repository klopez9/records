Doubly-Linked List and Template project

This project amounted to a proof-of-concept, showcasing a student's
 ability to implement doubly-linked lists and templating in a C++
 program. This program adds records of multiple types to separate
 doubly-linked lists. There are three types of records: StudentRecords,
 AlumniRecords, and EmployeeRecords.
